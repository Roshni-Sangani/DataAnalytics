Exception Handling in Python

Exception handling is a way to manage errors in Python. 

It helps prevent a program from crashing when something goes wrong. 

Instead of stopping, Python catches the error and lets you handle it properly.

What is an Error in Python?

Errors are issues in a program that stop it from running. There are two main types:

Syntax Errors – When you write incorrect Python code. Example:

print("Hello" # Missing closing bracket

Exceptions – Errors that happen while the program is running. Example:

a = 5 / 0  # ZeroDivisionError
